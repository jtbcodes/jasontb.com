This is Haystack Rock which sits in the Pacific Ocean, and is 235 feet tall.

When you step on the barnacles with shoes on, you can knock them off but if you didn't have shoes on, you would cut your feet on them. One purpose for barnacles is that birds can eat them.

This type of barnacle, which are called gooseneck barnacles, can be eaten by humans.

When you climb on the rocks, you can knock off seaweed. When it is covered by water, the seaweed is like an underwater forest, which is a hiding place for many fish and food for other fish.

When you climb on Haystack Rock, there are often bird nests on the rock. Birds get startled very easily. You can scare them away. They can even knock their eggs or little baby birds out of their nests, which could make them so frightened that they don't come back.

So basically how we care for the rock and other rocks also affects us.
