This is a sea anemone. It is a creature that lives under the water in the ocean.

When they are out of the water they hang off of the rocks like this. When they are out of water they close up with water inside so they don't dry out and die.

When they are underwater like this, they use their sticky tentacles to capture food. Then they shock it to kill it. They close up into a ball to eat their food.

They have one hole for everything. Food goes in and waste goes out.
